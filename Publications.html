Motivated by real-world applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, this paper introduces a decentralized control mechanism to guide steering control of autonomous agents manoeuvring in the vicinity of multiple moving entities (e.g. other autonomous agents) and stationary entities (e.g. fixed beacons or points of reference) in a three-dimensional environment. The proposed control law, which can be perceived as a modification of the three-dimensional constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, provides a means to allocate simultaneous attention to multiple entities. We investigate the behaviour of the closed-loop dynamics for a system with one agent referencing two beacons, as well as a two-agent mutual pursuit system wherein each agent employs the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent and a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control parameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria with agents moving on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes perpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacons. As the common radius and distances from the beacon are determined by the choice of parameters in the pursuit law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in a three-dimensional setting.

Neonicotinoids are a globally prevalent class of pesticides that can negatively affect bees and the pollination services they provide. While there is evidence suggesting that colony size may play an important role in mitigating neonicotinoid exposure in bees, mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests. Our results suggest that changes in both number of workers and nest architecture may contribute to making larger colonies less sensitive to pesticide exposure.

We study the dynamics of a low-dimensional system of coupled model neurons as a step towards understanding the vastly complex network of neurons in the brain. We analyze the bifurcation structure of a system of two model neurons with unidirectional coupling as a function of two physiologically relevant parameters: the external current input only to the first neuron and the strength of the coupling from the first to the second neuron. Leveraging a timescale separation, we prove necessary conditions for multiple timescale phenomena observed in the coupled system, including canard solutions and mixed mode oscillations. For a larger network of model neurons, we present a sufficient condition for phase locking when external inputs are heterogeneous. Finally, we generalize our results to directed trees of model neurons with heterogeneous inputs.

We studied social decision-making in the rule-based improvisational dance There Might Be Others, where dancers make in-the-moment compositional choices. Rehearsals provided a natural test-bed with communication restricted to non-verbal cues. We observed a key artistic explore–exploit tension in which the dancers switched between exploitation of existing artistic opportunities and riskier exploration of new ones. We investigated how the rules influenced the dynamics using rehearsals together with a model generalized from evolutionary dynamics. We tuned the rules to heighten the tension and modelled nonlinear fitness and feedback dynamics for mutation rate to capture the observed temporal phasing of the dancers' exploration-versus-exploitation. Using bifurcation analysis, we identified key controls of the tension and showed how they could shape the decision-making dynamics of the model much like turning a ‘dial’ in the instructions to the dancers could shape the dance. The investigation became an integral part of the development of the dance.

Neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect bee colonies, but the behavioral mechanisms by which these compounds impair colony growth remain unclear. Here, we investigate imidacloprid’s effects on bumblebee worker behavior within the nest, using an automated, robotic platform for continuous, multicolony monitoring of uniquely identified workers. We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy. Our results show that neonicotinoids induce widespread disruption of within-nest worker behavior that may contribute to impaired growth, highlighting the potential of automated techniques for characterizing the multifaceted, dynamic impacts of stressors on behavior in bee colonies.

Cyclic pursuit frameworks, which are built upon pursuit interactions between neighboring agents in a cycle graph, provide an efficient way to create useful global behaviors in a collective of autonomous robots. Previous work had considered cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, and demonstrated the existence of circling equilibria for the corresponding dynamics. In this work, we propose a beacon-referenced version of the CB pursuit law, wherein a stationary beacon provides an additional reference for the individual agents in a collective. When implemented in a cyclic framework, we show that the resulting dynamics admit relative equilibria corresponding to a circling orbit around the beacon, with the circling radius and the distribution of agents along the orbit determined by parameters of the proposed pursuit law. We also derive necessary conditions for stability of the circling equilibria, which provides a guide for parameter selection. Finally, by introducing a change of variables, we demonstrate the existence of a family of invariant manifolds related to spiraling motions around the beacon which preserve the "pure shape" of the collective, and study the reduced dynamics on a representative manifold.

Spreading processes that propagate through local interactions have been studied in multiple fields (e.g., epidemiology, complex networks, social sciences) using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) frameworks. SIR assumes individuals acquire full immunity to the infection after recovery, while SIS assumes individuals acquire no immunity after recovery. However, in many spreading processes individuals may acquire only partial immunity to the infection or may become more susceptible to reinfection after recovery. We study a model for reinfection called SIRI (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected). The SIRI model generalizes the SIS and SIR models and allows for study of systems in which the susceptibility of agents changes irreversibly after first exposure to the infection. We show that when the rate of reinfection is higher than the rate of primary infection, the SIRI model exhibits bistability with a small difference in the initial fraction of infected individuals determining whether the infection dies out or spreads through the population. We find this critical value and show that when the infection does not die out there is a resurgent epidemic in which the number of infected individuals decays initially and remains at a low level for an arbitrarily long period of time before rapidly increasing towards an endemic equilibrium in which the fraction of infected individuals is non-zero.

Finding the conditions that foster synchronization in networked nonlinear systems is critical to understanding a wide range of biological and mechanical systems. However, the conditions proved in the literature for synchronization in nonlinear systems with linear coupling, such as has been used to model neuronal networks, are in general not strict enough to accurately determine the system behavior. We leverage contraction theory to derive new sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization in terms of the network structure, for a network where the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of each node may differ. Our result requires that network connections satisfy a cluster-input-equivalence condition, and we explore the influence of this requirement on network dynamics. For application to networks of nodes with FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics, we show that our new sufficient condition is tighter than those found in previous analyses that used smooth or nonsmooth Lyapunov functions. Improving the analytical conditions for when cluster synchronization will occur based on network configuration is a significant step toward facilitating understanding and control of complex networked systems.

Motion planning and stabilization of the inverted pendulum on a cart is a much-studied problem in the control community. We focus our attention on asymptotically stabilizing a vertically upright flexible beam fixed on a moving cart. The flexibility of the beam is restricted only to the direction along the traverse of the cart. The control objective is to attenuate the effect of disturbances on the vertically upright profile of the beam. The control action available is the motion of the cart. By regulating this motion, we seek to regulate the shape of the beam. The problem presents a combination of a system described by a partial differential equation (PDE) and a cart modeled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as well as a controller which we restrict to an ODE. We set our problem in the port-controlled Hamiltonian framework. The interconnection of the flexible beam to the cart is viewed as a power-conserving interconnection of an infinite-dimensional system to a finite-dimensional system. The energy-Casimir method is employed to obtain the controller. In this method, we look for some constants of motion that are invariant of the choice of controller Hamiltonian. These Casimirs relate the controller states to the states of the system. We finally prove the stability of the equilibrium configuration of the closed-loop system.

In this paper, we introduce Symplectic ODE-Net (SymODEN), a deep learning framework which can infer the dynamics of a physical system, 
given by an ordinary differential equation (ODE), from observed state trajectories. To achieve better generalization with fewer 
training samples, SymODEN incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed 
manner. In particular, we enforce Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way, which can 
then be leveraged to draw insight about relevant physical aspects of the system, such as mass and potential energy. In addition, 
we propose a parametrization which can enforce this Hamiltonian formalism even when the generalized coordinate data is embedded in a 
high-dimensional space or we can only access velocity data instead of generalized momentum. This framework, by offering interpretable, 
physically-consistent models for physical systems, opens up new possibilities for synthesizing model-based control strategies.

Microstructures of a material form the bridge linking processing conditions - which can be controlled, to the material property - 
which is the primary interest in engineering applications. Thus a critical task in material design is establishing the 
processing-structure relationship, which requires domain expertise and techniques that can model the high-dimensional material 
microstructure. This work proposes a deep learning based approach that models the processing-structure relationship as a conditional 
image synthesis problem. In particular, we develop an auxiliary classifier Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (ACWGAN-GP) to 
synthesize microstructures under a given processing condition. This approach is free of feature engineering, requires modest domain 
knowledge and is applicable to a wide range of material systems. We demonstrate this approach using the ultra high carbon steel (UHCS) 
database, where each microstructure is annotated with a label describing the cooling method it was subjected to. Our results show that 
ACWGAN-GP can synthesize high-quality multiphase microstructures for a given cooling method.

Coexistence and interaction of multiple strategies in a large population of individuals can be observed in a variety of natural and engineered settings. In this context, replicator-mutator dynamics provide an efficient tool to model and analyze the evolution of the fractions of the total population committed to different strategies. Although the literature addresses existence and stability of equilibrium points and limit cycles of these dynamics, linearity in fitness functions has typically been assumed. We generalize these dynamics by introducing a nonlinear fitness function, and we show that the replicator-mutator dynamics for two competing strategies exhibit a quintic pitchfork bifurcation. Then, by designing slow-time-scale feedback dynamics to control the bifurcation parameter (mutation rate), we show that the closed-loop dynamics can exhibit oscillations in the evolution of population fractions. Finally, we introduce an ultraslow-time-scale dynamics to control the associated unfolding parameter (asymmetry in the payoff structure), and demonstrate an even richer class of behaviors.

Cyclic pursuit frameworks provide an efficient way to create useful global behaviors out of pairwise interactions in a collective of autonomous robots. Earlier work studied cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, and has demonstrated the existence of a variety of interesting behaviors for the corresponding dynamics. In this work, by attaching multiple branches to a single cycle, we introduce a modified version of this framework which allows us to consider any weakly connected pursuit graph where each node has an outdegree of 1. This provides a further generalization of the cyclic pursuit setting. Then, after showing existence of relative equilibria (rectilinear or circling motion), pure shape equilibria (spiraling motion) and periodic orbits, we also derive necessary conditions for stability of a 3-agent collective. By paving a way for individual agents to join or leave a collective without perturbing the motion of others, our approach leads to improved reliability of the overall system.

Cyclic pursuit frameworks provide an efficient way to create useful global behaviors out of pairwise interactions in a collective of autonomous robots. Earlier work studied cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, and has demonstrated the existence of a variety of interesting behaviors for the corresponding dynamics. In this work, by attaching multiple branches to a single cycle, we introduce a modified version of this framework which allows us to consider any weakly connected pursuit graph where each node has an outdegree of 1. This provides a further generalization of the cyclic pursuit setting. Then, after showing existence of relative equilibria (rectilinear or circling motion), pure shape equilibria (spiraling motion) and periodic orbits, we also derive necessary conditions for stability of a 3-agent collective. By paving a way for individual agents to join or leave a collective without perturbing the motion of others, our approach leads to improved reliability of the overall system.

A key feature of neural network architectures is their ability to support the simultaneous interaction among large numbers of units in the learning and processing of representations. However, how the richness of such interactions trades off against the ability of a network to simultaneously carry out multiple independent processes - a salient limitation in many domains of human cognition - remains largely unexplored. In this paper we use a graph-theoretic analysis of network architecture to address this question, where tasks are represented as edges in a bipartite graph <i>G = (A &#x222A B, E)</i>. We define a new measure of multitasking capacity of such networks, based on the assumptions that tasks that need to be multitasked rely on independent resources, i.e., form a matching, and that tasks can be multitasked without interference if they form an induced matching. Our main result is an inherent tradeoff between the multitasking capacity and the average degree of the network that holds regardless of the network architecture. These results are also extended to networks of depth greater than 2. On the positive side, we demonstrate that networks that are random-like (e.g., locally sparse) can have desirable multitasking properties. Our results shed light into the parallel-processing limitations of neural systems and provide insights that may be useful for the analysis and design of parallel architectures.

This paper introduces a formal method to model the level of demand on control when executing cognitive processes. The cost of cognitive control is parsed into an <i>intensity cost</i> which encapsulates how much additional input information is required so as to get the specified response, and an <i>interaction cost</i> which encapsulates the level of interference between individual processes in a network. We develop a formal relationship between the probability of successful execution of desired processes and the control signals (additive control biases). This relationship is also used to specify optimal control policies to achieve a desired probability of activation for processes. We observe that there are boundary cases when finding such control policies which leads us to introduce the interaction cost. We show that the interaction cost is influenced by the relative strengths of individual processes, as well as the directionality of the underlying competition between processes.

One of the most salient and well-recognized features of human goal-directed behavior is our limited ability to conduct multiple demanding tasks at once. Previous work has identified overlap between task processing pathways as a limiting factor for multitasking performance in neural architectures. This raises an important question: insofar as shared representation between tasks introduces the risk of cross-talk and thereby limitations in multitasking, why would the brain prefer shared task representations over separate representations across tasks? We seek to answer this question by introducing formal considerations and neural network simulations in which we contrast the multitasking limitations that shared task representations incur with their benefits for task learning. Our results suggest that neural network architectures face a fundamental tradeoff between learning efficiency and multitasking performance in environments with shared structure between tasks.

Investigation of synchronization phenomena in  networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators plays a pivotal role in understanding the behavior of biological and mechanical systems with oscillatory properties. We derive a general sufficient condition for synchronization of a network of nonlinear oscillators using a nonsmooth Lyapunov function, and we obtain conditions under which synchronization is guaranteed for a network of Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FN) oscillators in biologically relevant model parameter regimes. We incorporate two types of heterogeneity into our study of FN oscillators: 1) the network structure is arbitrary and 2) the oscillators have non-identical external inputs. Understanding the effects of heterogeneities on synchronization of oscillators with inputs provides a promising step toward control of key aspects of networked oscillatory systems.

The limited ability to simultaneously perform multiple tasks is one of the most salient features of human performance and a defining characteristic of controlled processing. Based on the assumption that multitasking constraints arise from shared representations between individual tasks, we describe a graph-theoretic approach to analyze these constraints. Our results are consistent with previous numerical work, showing that even modest amounts of shared representation induce dramatic constraints on the parallel processing capability of a network architecture. We further illustrate how this analysis method can be applied to specific neural networks to efficiently characterize the full profile of their parallel processing capabilities. We present simulation results that validate theoretical predictions, and discuss how these methods can be applied to empirical studies of controlled vs. and automatic processing and multitasking performance in humans.

Cyclic pursuit systems provide a means to generate useful global behaviors in a collective of autonomous agents based on dyadic pursuit interactions between neighboring agents in a cycle graph. Here we consider a modified version of the cyclic pursuit framework in which a stationary beacon provides an additional reference for the agents in the system. Building on the framework proposed in our previous work, we derive necessary conditions for stability of circling equilibria in the <i>n</i>-agent system. Furthermore, we employ a change of variables to reveal the existence of a family of invariant manifolds related to spiral motions which maintain the formation shape up to geometric similarity.

We investigate group behavior in dance using an evolutionary dynamic model. Our approach is motivated by observations of nineteen dancers during a performance in which they choose a sequence of dance movements from a <i>finite set of allowable movement modules</i> as they  perform. Results show evidence that subgroups of dancers performing the same movement module with greater representation are aware of their <i>dominance</i>, which in turn influences their switching rates between modules. We introduce the notion of <i>awareness of dominance</i> into the well-studied framework of replicator-mutator dynamics, where modules are represented as strategies. By letting awareness of dominance tune mutation strength, we demonstrate its influence in the evolution of strategies. The tuning yields a feedback controlled bifurcation in the model dynamics, which predicts persistence of dominant strategies as observed in the behavior of the dance group.

This paper investigates a modification of cyclic CB pursuit in a multi-agent system in which each agent pays attention to a neighbor and a beacon. The problem admits shape equilibria with collective circling about the beacon, with the circling radius and angular separation of agents determined by choice of parameters in the feedback law. Stability of circling shape equilibria is shown for a 2-agent system, and the results are demonstrated on a collective of mobile robots tracked by a motion capture system.

Drawing inspiration from flight behavior in biological settings (e.g. territorial battles in dragonflies, and flocking in starlings), this paper demonstrates two strategies for coverage and flocking. Using earlier theoretical studies on mutual motion camouflage, an appropriate steering control law for area coverage has been implemented in a laboratory testbed equipped with wheeled mobile robots and a Vicon high speed motion capture system. The same test-bed is also used to demonstrate another strategy (based on local information), termed topological velocity alignment, which serves to make agents move in the same direction. The present work illustrates the applicability of biological inspiration in the design of multiagent robotic collectives.

The problem of recovering continuous time signals from a set of discrete measurements is ill-posed in a classical sense (non-uniqueness of solution). Our approach introduces generative models with inputs, states and outputs, and regularizes this problem by trading total fit-error against suitable penalty functionals of input and state. This enables us to apply techniques from optimal control and obtain solutions in a semi-analytical way. Using a modified version of Pontryagin's maximum principle, this paper treats data smoothing as an optimal control problem. In addition to addressing data smoothing problems in Euclidean settings, our results are also applicable to problems arising in finite dimensional matrix Lie group settings. In particular, this paper discusses an example problem on <i>SE(2)</i>, and exploits symmetry and reduction to an integrable Hamiltonian system as means to data smoothing.

In many areas of science and engineering there is a need for techniques to robustly extract velocity and its derivatives from a finite sample of observed positions. The extracted information can be used to infer related quantities such as curvature and speed, which are important for analysis of strategies and feedback laws associated with the motion. In this work a novel approach is proposed to reconstruct trajectories from a set of discrete observations. A simple linear model is used as the generative model for trajectories, and high values of the jerk (derivative of the acceleration) path integral are penalized during reconstruction. The positions, reconstructed in this way, can be represented as a linear combination of the sample data. The regularization (penalty) parameter plays a very important role in the reconstruction process, and it may be determined from data using ordinary cross validation.

Motion planning and stabilization of the inverted pendulum on a cart is a much studied problem in the control community. We focus our attention on asymptotically stabilizing a vertically upright flexible beam fixed on a moving cart. The flexibility of the beam is restricted only to the direction along the traverse of the cart. The control objective is to attenuate the effect of disturbances on the vertically upright profile of the beam. The control action available is the motion of the cart. By regulating this motion, we seek to regulate the shape of the beam. The problem presents a combination of a system described by a partial differential equation (PDE) and a cart modeled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as well as controller which we restrict to an ODE. We set our problem in the port controlled Hamiltonian framework. The interconnection of the flexible beam to the cart is viewed as a power conserving interconnection of an infinite dimensional system to a finite dimensional system. The energy Casimir method is employed to obtain the controller. In this method, we look for some constants of motion which are invariant of the choice of controller Hamiltonian. These Casimirs relate the controller states to the states of the system. We finally prove stability of the equilibrium configuration of the closed loop system.
